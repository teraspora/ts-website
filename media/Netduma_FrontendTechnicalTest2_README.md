# Netduma Address Book (Author: John Lynch, Date: 2019-10-01)

## Introduction

This document describes in brief development issues encountered while developing an Address Book web site for the Netduma Frontend Technical Test 2.

## Issues encountered

No insoluble issues were encountered, only those caused by me, for the debugging of which the Chrome Dev Tools proved invaluable.

The following functionality remains to be implemented

- Save to local storage, certainly if user clicks "Save", and possibly at regular intervals
- Add code to load from local storage when page refreshed
- Display form to allow user to add a contact; validate input and add to contacts
- Fix code to delete a contact, as it seems to be the wrong element getting deleted.
- Complete code to find a contact based on a user-supplied field value

## Future changes
        >If you were to have 1-2 weeks on this task, what would you do to improve the program?

- Improve layout and styling; make responsive for mobile
- Implement manual testing, cross-browser testing and unit tests.
- Add ability for user to edit a contact
- Add ability for user to choose the address book file
