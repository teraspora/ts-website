		<h1>Shaders</h1>
		<p>These animations are created by small programs running on your GPU - the graphics processor in your computer.</p>

		<p>Hover over one and you'll see a play button and a fullscreen option.</p>
		<p>Instead of your CPU computing the colours of the all pixels to be displayed for every screen image (ideally about sixty times a second), it sends little programs called shaders to the GPU, which the GPU itself then runs in parallel thousands of times on very specialised processors , to generate every pixel value for the viewport.</p>
			
		<p>By manipulating mathematical functions according to the position of the pixel on the screen and the time since the animation started, it's possible to generate all sorts of interesting effects.</p>
		<p>I have only recently discovered this form of programming,
		<iframe class="ifrm-left" width="320" height="180" frameborder="0" src="https://www.shadertoy.com/embed/4tVyDd?gui=true&t=10&paused=false" allowfullscreen></iframe> and it gives me great joy to have found a new way of making art from mathematics.</p>
		<p>But shaders are not just about art, or even just about rendering data to the screen.   The ability of graphics processors to do thousands of calculations in parallel gives them applications in Bitcoin 
			mining and artificial intelligence, for example.   In fact, some of the newest GPUs have special instructions built into their hardware which facilitate the computations needed by neural networks, so training such networks on very large datasets is far more feasible.   The use of GPUs and massive parallelisation of computation for all sorts of other applications is a hot area of research currently, and we can expect interesting developments over the next few years.   Maybe people will soon forget why they're called GPUs, as the original specialisation of the word disappears and they become really useful general-purpose workhorses utilised for a wide range of tasks in our digital lives.</p>

		<h1>Voronoi Diagrams</h1>
		<p>
			You are looking at animated Voronoi diagrams.   They arise from plotting a number of "fixed points", then plotting the loci of points that are equidistant from the two nearest fixed points.   Here I'm animating the results by varying some parameters with time.  Voronoi diagrams result in tesselations of the plane,

			The animation is coded in a &#34;shader&#34;, a small program which runs entirely on your graphics chip.   For more info see <a href="shaders.html">here</a>.

			<span class="note">Mathematical note:</span> distance may be defined in terms of any valid distance metric, but generally some form of Minkowski distance, such as Euclidean distance (order 2) or Manhattan distance (order 1).  Here I'm using the latter.

			And in case your wondering, the middle tile is just a bunch of sine waves having a party.   They're my friends. ;)
