			About me
		</h1>
		<p>
			Hi.   I'm John Lynch.   I love coding, playing with mathematics, and using both of these to create digital art.   I also love playing music (piano, sax, tin whistles), growing vegetables, trees and even a few flowers; cooking and making chutneys, marmalades etc.; and enjoying good coffee, preferably freshly-ground and ideally not long roasted!
		</p>
		<p>
			Back in the day, I did a mathematics degree at Hull University, since which I've worked with computers for many years in a variety of roles, mostly involving operations and technical support, as well as running a PC factory, but over the past few years my early passion for coding has, delightfully, returned.   And I've been using it, and my mathematical knowledge, to create digital art, mainly using Java and Clojure, but lately also in GLSL, directly programming the GPU.
		</p>
		<p>   All this stuff is quite specialised, though, so in January 2018 I enrolled on a <a target="_blank" href="https://courses.codeinstitute.net/program/FullstackWebDeveloper">Code Institute course</a> to learn all the technologies required to develop both the front- and back-ends of websites and web applications, and to understand all the necessary wiring that serves to knit all these technologies together.</p>
		<p> These days I'm living in the wild hills of West Cork, Ireland, but over the years have worked in various parts of the UK, Ireland, Australia, Spain, Italy and Thailand.  
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If you're interested in hiring me as a programmer; if you need a website, would like help with creating one yourself; if you'd like to learn how to program your computer; or if you'd like a talk for your organisation about fractals and digital art, together with live projected fractal images, videos and animations, please contact me at the (obfuscated) address:

		<h1 class = "intro" id="about-this-website">About this website</h1>
<p>This website was lovingly crafted by hand, using raw semantic HTML5 and CSS3.  It has formed the substance of the first &quot;milestone project&quot; I have had to complete as part of my studies on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codeinstitute.net/mentored-online/">Full-stack Developer course at Code Institute in Dublin</a>.</p>
<h2>Technical Info</h2>
<p>
	I did not use any preprocessors like Sass or HAML, or CSS libraries like Bootstrap, as I felt I first needed to learn the nuts and bolts, particularly of CSS.   The only external resources used are Google Fonts (for <a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mali">Mali</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik">Rubik</a>), Font Awesome for social media icons, and embedded iframes from Youtube and Shadertoy, which is all my own content in the form of fractal videos and shader programs I've created myself.</p>
<p>
	All the images are mine.   The photographs were taken with my Nikon Coolpix P500 digital SLR camera, and the fractal images were generated by a Java escape-time fractal program which I have been developing over the past couple of years.   I use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> to resize them where necessary, or occasionally <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>.</p>
	<p>
	I produce the videos from an escape-time-fractal-image-producing program I have been developing over the past couple of years.   By iterating the Julia sets of compositions of complex trig. functions and varying the constant, I produce image sequences.   I add title sequences with another Java program of mine, and then pass them to <a target="_blank" href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">ImageJ</a> to turn into an <code>.avi</code> video, then through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">VLC Player</a> to compress to a more manageable <code>.mp4</code> file, ready for uploading to Youtube.
	</p>
<p>
	I write the articles in Markdown and use a web service like <a target="_blank" href="https://markdowntohtml.com/">https://markdowntohtml.com/</a> to convert to HTML, then edit the HTML if necessary. For version control I use Git on my local machine. For vendor-specific prefixes I used <a href="https://autoprefixer.github.io/">Autoprefixer CSS online</a>.</p>
<p>
	I used CSS Grid to lay out the content.  I experimented by building dummy pages while watching Rachel Andrew's and Wes Bos's tutorials.   Together with using viewport units, CSS Grid seems to make it easier to make the site responsive and to make elements behave themselves when the user resizes the viewport.
</p>
<p>
	I used <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 3</a> in dual-pane mode to code it on my local machine, with the editor on the laptop screen and the site displaying in a browser window on an external monitor, using <code>Ctrl+s Alt+Tab F5</code> to see a refreshed page in the browser.
	It was tested continually as I developed it, in Firefox Developer Edition v.63.0 (64-bit) and Chromium v.69.0, using both Firefox and Chromium developer tools, and nearing the conclusion of the project also on other physical devices.
</p>

<p>
	Ongoing testing includes Safari, Opera, Edge, IE and eventually, text-based browsers.   I also intend to research meta-tags etc. and SEO in general in order to better attract visitors.
</p>
<p>I have availed of many resources around the web to help me learn.   The following is far from a complete list, but it covers those which were most important for me.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/5656369/john">Stack Overflow</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS_TRICKS</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rachelandrew.co.uk/">Rachel Andrew&#39;s tutorials</a>, and in particular her</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://gridbyexample.com/">CSS Grid tutorial series</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://wesbos.com/javascript30/">Wes Bos&#39;s Javascript 30 tutorial series</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/tag/css">Scott Tolinkski&#39;s CSS tutorials</a> </li>
<li>The code-institute-room at <a target="_blank" href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>, </li>
<li>and finally, on old-fashioned paper, a very good 1080-page book by David Flanagan, called <span class="book-title">&quot;Javascript: The Definitive Guide&quot;</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I use a quad-core Asus laptop with 8GB RAM, running Xubuntu 18.04 for all my development.</p>
<p>
	The website is hosted with Blacknight at the domain teraspora.net, which I own.
</p>
<h2>Purpose & Functionality</h2>
<p>
	<ul>
<li>to present some of my digital art creations to the world;</li>
<li>to fulfil the requirements of the first &quot;milestone project&quot; of my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codeinstitute.net/mentored-online/">Code Institute course</a>;</li>
<li>to be an online shed where I can store things, try out new tools in real-online-world ways;</li>
<li>eventually to be a sales portal for physical renderings of my digital art. </li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
	It is, I hope, structured in an intuitive way, with a main navigation bar at the top, footer at the bottom and content in two areas in between.   The styling is consistent through all pages.   Links are styled to change colour when hovered upon, and external links open in a new tab.   The main navigation links also scale up very slightly in size to encourage the user to click them!
	<p>The footer contains icons for Twitter, Github, LinkedIn and Shadertoy, which link as expected to my accounts on the respective platforms.  The two content panels are displayed next to each other between header and footer on desktop, while on mobile in portrait mode all areas are in one column. </p>
